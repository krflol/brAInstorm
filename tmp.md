It looks like you'd like me to write some chapters for the cyber attack story based on the provided character outlines and story nodes. Here are two chapters based on this framework:

**Chapter 3: The Meeting Point**

Eric's muscles burned as he pushed through the throngs of bewildered people on the streets of Tallahassee. The once vibrant city had descended into a maze of confusion and unease within hours of the blackout. Mobile phones had turned into lifeless slabs of glass and metal in the absence of a network, leaving many to feel isolated and stranded.

Eric navigated through the chaos with one objective in mind—to reach the marina. There, Hector Ramirez, with his boat, awaited to set off on a journey that was meticulously planned yet uncertain in its trajectory. Every step taken was a step closer to home, or so Eric hoped.

En route, he swung by the university. He knew Dr. Anna Zheng would either be on campus, laboring to secure her years of research, or at her home, which was equipped to be a stronghold in the event of any catastrophe. He had to ensure she was informed and safe; the group's success depended on every member's well-being.

Upon arriving, he found Anna in her lab, head bent over her emergency comms, the solar-powered emergency lights casting an eerie glow on her face. She looked up as he entered, relief evident in her eyes. "Eric, I got the message. Is everyone else okay?"

"We're gathering. It's time to execute the plan," Eric confirmed, his voice firm.

Anna nodded and grabbed her own get-home bag, packed with essentials. Her understanding of energy systems would be invaluable in the days ahead.

Together, they left the lab behind, heading toward the rendezvous point.

**Chapter 4: The Night Passage**

The hush of the evening was an eerie contrast to the day's disarray. On the dock, Hector's boat bobbed gently in the water, ready to cut through the now-powerless world. Amidst the vast silence, the soft lapping of the waves against the hull seemed louder than ever.

As Eric and Anna approached, Hector emerged from the shadows, an unspoken understanding passing between them. The preparation phase of their plan had ended. Now, it was time to act.

"Let's get moving. We have a schedule to keep if we're to avoid attention," Hector whispered, as he helped his companions aboard.

Eric took the helm, starting the boat's quiet electric motor—a strategic choice for stealth. They needed the cover of darkness to travel undetected, to pick up other members of the Mutual Assistance Group. Hector manned the radio, keeping a vigilant ear tuned to the emergency channels, while Anna surveyed the equipment, ensuring all was in order.

The boat slipped through the waters, the shoreline an ominous silhouette against the faint starlight. To their left arose the university where Anna had spent her days innovating for a better future—a future now cast into uncertainty.

They passed areas that were familiar to them all, but tonight, they bore the look of a world changed, undefined by the normalcy of the grid, shaped instead by an unsettling quiet.

Their next stop was to collect Courtney Latham. As Courtney climbed aboard, she brought news of growing unrest—shops being looted, streets blocked off by impromptu barricades, and the worrying silence of the emergency services.

The journey continued with tension coiling tighter with each new encounter, but the purpose that united them was stronger than the fear that stalked the unknown path ahead. The group's diverse abilities, from Jeff Stanley's medical expertise to Jasmine Clark's law enforcement experience, would be their edge in facing this new world.

Through the pitch-black night, the quiet hum of the boat's motor became a signal—not of the fall of the grid—but of the resolve and resourcefulness of those who had planned for darkness, who would strive together towards the light of a new dawn.
